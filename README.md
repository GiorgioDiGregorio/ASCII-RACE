# ASCII-RACE
Group project made for the Programming Course at Unibo (a.a.2019/2020), consisting in a car-race game written in C++, using Visual Studio.

### Some features:
- It is possible to choose the level of difficulty between easy, normal and difficult (it will affect the amount of damages and the number of enemies you'll have on screen);
- The player moves the main car with keyboard commands. There is no final milestone, but you continue to level up by earning points over time and through upgrades;
- Going astray, hitting an opponent's car or an obstacle will cause you to lose points (Game Over if the score drops to 0);
- The map is dynamically generated, one level at a time, in ASCII graphics;
